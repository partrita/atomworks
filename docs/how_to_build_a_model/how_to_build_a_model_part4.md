## Introduction
This is the fourth and final tutorial in the **How to Build a Model Using AtomWorks** series. By now you have:

- Parquet files for your `train`/`val`/`test` splits ([Part 1](how_to_build_a_model_part1.md)).
- A loader that turns each parquet row into a protein-ligand structure ([Part 2](how_to_build_a_model_part2.md)).
- A transform pipeline that crops the pocket and converts it into tensors ([Part 2](how_to_build_a_model_part2.md)).
- A `PocketDockGNN` model in `model.py` ([Part 3](how_to_build_a_model_part3.md)).

**In this installment, you will write `train.py`, which wires all of these pieces together to train, validate, checkpoint, and test the model.**

```{important}
This tutorial completes the training script using the [AtomWorks API](../api_reference.rst), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/index). The full solution is available in the [tutorial files](./scripts/index.rst), and the code below is hidden in collapsible cells so you can attempt each step yourself first.
```

(aw_build_model_p4_prereq)=
## Prerequisites
Before starting this part it is assumed that you have:
- Completed [Parts 1–3](index.rst), with `transforms.py` and `model.py` in place.
- A working installation of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable).
- Access to a GPU (the example trainer is configured for a single GPU, but you can change the accelerator).

(aw_build_model_p4_overview)=
## What the Training Script Does
`train.py` wires together four pieces:

1. Read the split parquets.
2. Load and transform each example into model inputs.
3. Instantiate your model (`PocketDockGNN`).
4. Train, validate, checkpoint, and test.

The model sees a pocket-centered graph with five tensors:

- **`atomic_numbers`**: atomic identity for each atom.
- **`input_coords`**: protein pocket coordinates are kept, ligand coordinates are zeroed out.
- **`target_coords`**: the true coordinates the model should predict.
- **`edge_index`**: bond graph connectivity.
- **`is_ligand`**: a boolean mask for which atoms belong to the ligand.

In other words, the task is: *given the protein pocket context and the ligand atoms, predict the ligand's 3D placement.*

(aw_build_model_p4_imports)=
## Imports and Global Settings
In a new file, `model.py`, import PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, the AtomWorks dataset utilities used in the previous scripts, the transforms you wrote in Part 2, and the model class from Part 3.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
import torch
import pandas as pd
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

from atomworks.ml.datasets import PandasDataset
from atomworks.ml.datasets.loaders import create_loader_with_query_pn_units
from atomworks.ml.transforms.filters import RemoveHydrogens, RemoveUnresolvedAtoms
from atomworks.ml.transforms.base import ConvertToTorch, Compose

from transforms import CropToPocket, FeaturizeForDocking
from model import PocketDockGNN
```
Note that we now also import {py:class}`~atomworks.ml.transforms.base.ConvertToTorch`, which turns the NumPy features from `FeaturizeForDocking` into `torch` tensors.
````

Add two small global settings: 
- `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("medium")`: a practical speed/precision trade-off for training. 
- `pl.seed_everything(42)`: makes runs more reproducible.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("medium")
pl.seed_everything(42)
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_config)=
## Configuration
Put the tunable settings from the previous scripts and the maximum sizes for our training, validation, and testing datasets in a `CONFIG` dictionary near the top of the file.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
CONFIG = {
    "hidden_dim": 128,
    "num_layers": 3,
    "learning_rate": 1e-3,
    "batch_size": 1,
    "max_epochs": 5,
    "pocket_radius": 10.0,
    "num_workers": 0,
    "max_train": 100,
    "max_val": 20,
    "max_test": 20,
}
```
````

```{note}
The `max_*` values cap how many examples we use so the run stays small and fast to troubleshoot. For actual training, remove these caps (set them to `None`) and train on the full splits.
```

(aw_build_model_p4_keys)=
## List the Tensor Keys
Your featurization step produces five tensors. Store those once in a `TENSOR_KEYS` list so the rest of the file can reuse the same list. This list is used both to tell `ConvertToTorch` what to convert and to tell the collate function what to stack.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
TENSOR_KEYS = [
    "atomic_numbers",
    "input_coords",
    "target_coords",
    "edge_index",
    "is_ligand",
]
```
````

```{important}
`TENSOR_KEYS` must be defined before the functions that reference it (`collate_fn` and `build_pipeline`). Keep it near the top of the file with `CONFIG`.
```

(aw_build_model_p4_robust)=
## Make the Dataset Robust to Bad Examples
If you train on real structures (which we are) some examples will fail. A ligand may have no resolved coordinates, or the pocket crop may remove everything useful. You do not want one bad structure to crash the entire run.

Wrap {py:class}`~atomworks.ml.datasets.PandasDataset` in a small `RobustDataset` that inherits from [`torch.utils.data.Dataset`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.13/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset). If a single example raises during loading or transform, it records the index and returns `None` instead of killing training.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
class RobustDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, dataset: PandasDataset):
        self.dataset = dataset
        self.failed = []

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.dataset)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        try:
            return self.dataset[idx]
        except Exception:
            self.failed.append(idx)
            return None
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_collate)=
## Write a Custom `collate_fn`
The default PyTorch collator is not a good fit here: the examples are variable-size graphs, the dataset may return `None`, and we only want to batch the specific tensors the model needs (ignoring any extra fields in the example dictionary). Your collate function should do two things: drop failed examples, and stack only the tensor keys the model expects.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
def collate_fn(batch):
    batch = [b for b in batch if b is not None]
    if len(batch) == 0:
        return None

    return {
        k: torch.stack([example[k] for example in batch])
        for k in TENSOR_KEYS
        if k in batch[0]
    }
```
With `batch_size=1`, this stacks a single example and adds a leading dimension of size 1, which the model's `_shared_step` removes with `.squeeze(0)`.
````

(aw_build_model_p4_pipeline)=
## Rebuild the Transform Pipeline
Write a helper that reconstructs the same transform sequence you tested in Part 2, now with `ConvertToTorch` appended so the features come out as `torch` tensors.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
def build_pipeline(radius: float) -> Compose:
    return Compose([
        RemoveHydrogens(),
        RemoveUnresolvedAtoms(),
        CropToPocket(radius=radius),
        FeaturizeForDocking(),
        ConvertToTorch(keys=TENSOR_KEYS),
    ])
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_factories)=
## Dataset and Dataloader Factories
Write one function that takes a split parquet path and returns a ready-to-use dataset (this is essentially what you did in `smoke_test.py`, wrapped in `RobustDataset`).

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
def build_dataset(parquet_path: str, name: str, radius: float, max_examples: int = None):
    df = pd.read_parquet(parquet_path)
    if max_examples is not None:
        df = df.head(max_examples).reset_index(drop=True)

    loader = create_loader_with_query_pn_units(
        pn_unit_iid_colnames=["pn_unit_1_iid", "pn_unit_2_iid"]
    )

    dataset = PandasDataset(
        data=df,
        name=name,
        id_column="example_id",
        loader=loader,
        transform=build_pipeline(radius),
        save_failed_examples_to_dir="failed_examples/",
    )
    return RobustDataset(dataset)
```
`save_failed_examples_to_dir` writes any example that fails inside the AtomWorks pipeline to disk so you can inspect it later.
````

Then write one small helper to build dataloaders consistently. This keeps the script tidy and reuses the same settings for train, validation, and test.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
def build_dataloader(dataset, shuffle: bool) -> DataLoader:
    return DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=CONFIG["batch_size"],
        shuffle=shuffle,
        num_workers=CONFIG["num_workers"],
        collate_fn=collate_fn,
        persistent_workers=False,
    )
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_build)=
## Build the Datasets and Dataloaders
Now the main script body. Start by building the three datasets.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
print("Building datasets...")
train_dataset = build_dataset(
    "splits/train.parquet", "docking_train", CONFIG["pocket_radius"], CONFIG["max_train"]
)
val_dataset = build_dataset(
    "splits/val.parquet", "docking_val", CONFIG["pocket_radius"], CONFIG["max_val"]
)
test_dataset = build_dataset(
    "splits/test.parquet", "docking_test", CONFIG["pocket_radius"], CONFIG["max_test"]
)

print(f"  Train: {len(train_dataset):,} examples")
print(f"  Val:   {len(val_dataset):,} examples")
print(f"  Test:  {len(test_dataset):,} examples")
```
````

Then build the dataloaders.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
train_loader = build_dataloader(train_dataset, shuffle=True)
val_loader = build_dataloader(val_dataset, shuffle=False)
test_loader = build_dataloader(test_dataset, shuffle=False)
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_model)=
## Instantiate the Model
Instantiate the network with the hyperparameters from `CONFIG`.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
model = PocketDockGNN(
    hidden_dim=CONFIG["hidden_dim"],
    num_layers=CONFIG["num_layers"],
    learning_rate=CONFIG["learning_rate"],
)
```
Optionally, print the parameter count as a sanity check that you built the expected network:
```python
print(f"\nModel parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()):,}")
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_callbacks)=
## Checkpointing and Early Stopping
Before creating the trainer, define the callbacks. Use `periodic_checkpoint` to give recovery points during training, and `best_checkpoint` to keep the best models by `val/loss`.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
periodic_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(
    dirpath="checkpoints/",
    filename="pocketdockgnn-{epoch:02d}-{step}",
    every_n_train_steps=50,
    save_last=True,
    verbose=True,
)

best_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(
    dirpath="checkpoints/",
    filename="pocketdockgnn-best-{epoch:02d}-{val/loss:.4f}",
    monitor="val/loss",
    mode="min",
    save_top_k=3,
    verbose=True,
)

callbacks = [
    best_checkpoint,
    periodic_checkpoint,
    EarlyStopping(
        monitor="val/loss",
        patience=10,
        mode="min",
        verbose=True,
    ),
]
```
The `EarlyStopping` callback stops training if validation loss stops improving for `patience` checks.
````

(aw_build_model_p4_trainer)=
## Create the Trainer
Now define the trainer itself with the [PyTorch Lightning `Trainer`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/core-api/trainer).

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(
    max_epochs=CONFIG["max_epochs"],
    accelerator="gpu",
    devices=1,
    callbacks=callbacks,
    log_every_n_steps=10,
    val_check_interval=50,
    enable_progress_bar=True,
)
```
````

```{tip}
If you do not have a GPU available, set `accelerator="cpu"` (and drop `devices=1`) to run the small capped example on CPU.
```

(aw_build_model_p4_fit)=
## Train and Evaluate
Call `fit()` to train.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
print("\nStarting training...")
trainer.fit(
    model,
    train_dataloaders=train_loader,
    val_dataloaders=val_loader,
)
```
````

After training, print some diagnostics: how many examples were skipped, and which checkpoint Lightning considered best.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
print(f"\nFailed examples during training: {len(train_dataset.failed)}")
print(f"Failed examples during val:      {len(val_dataset.failed)}")
print(f"Best checkpoint:                {best_checkpoint.best_model_path}")
```
````

Finally, evaluate on the held-out test split using the best checkpoint.

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
print("\nEvaluating on test set...")
trainer.test(
    model,
    dataloaders=test_loader,
    ckpt_path=best_checkpoint.best_model_path,
)

print("\nDone.")
```
````

(aw_build_model_p4_wrap)=
## Wrapping Up
You have now built a complete, if simplified, machine-learning pipeline with AtomWorks: from raw PDB metadata to a trained pose-generation model. As next steps you might:

- Remove the `max_*` caps and train on the full splits.
- Add symmetric edges or an equivariant architecture to remove the model's dependence on absolute coordinates (see the warning in [Part 3](how_to_build_a_model_part3.md)).
- Track additional metrics, such as per-example ligand RMSD distributions, or visualize predicted poses.

(aw_build_model_p4_inference)=
## Running Inference on a Trained Model
`trainer.test()` reports metrics, but it does not hand you the predicted poses. To get coordinates for a new pocket-ligand example, reload the best checkpoint and call the model directly. You can find a `inference.py` script in the [tutorial files](./scripts/index.rst).

````{dropdown} Click to see the code
```python
model = PocketDockGNN.load_from_checkpoint(best_checkpoint.best_model_path)
model.eval()

batch = next(iter(test_loader))
atomic_numbers = batch["atomic_numbers"].squeeze(0)
input_coords = batch["input_coords"].squeeze(0)
edge_index = batch["edge_index"].squeeze(0)
is_ligand = batch["is_ligand"].squeeze(0)

with torch.no_grad():
    pred_coords = model(atomic_numbers, input_coords, edge_index)

predicted_ligand_coords = pred_coords[is_ligand]
```
The `.squeeze(0)` calls undo the batch dimension `DataLoader` adds, matching what `_shared_step` does internally. Only the rows where `is_ligand` is `True` are the coordinates you asked the model to predict. The rest are the (unchanged) protein pocket context.
````

```{note}
`pred_coords` is a raw coordinate prediction, not validated molecular geometry. Check bond lengths and clashes before treating it as a usable pose.
```

(aw_build_model_p4_glossary)=
## Glossary

**Collate function:** a function that assembles a list of examples into a single batch; here it also drops failed (`None`) examples.

**Checkpoint:** a saved snapshot of model weights (and optimizer state) that can be reloaded to resume training or run evaluation.

**Early stopping:** halting training once a monitored metric (here `val/loss`) stops improving, to save compute and reduce overfitting.
